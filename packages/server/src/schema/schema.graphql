freeCodeCamp Curriculum GraphQL API Schema
Sprint 004 - Schema Definition and Code Generation

This schema defines the complete API contract for curriculum metadata queries.
All types map to internal TypeScript types via @graphql-codegen type mappers.

Metadata/Content Separation:
- Challenge metadata (id, title) always available
- Challenge content (description, instructions, tests) returns null in MVP
- ChallengeContent types included for future v2 database integration

Type Mappers (configured in codegen.ts):
- Curriculum → CurriculumData
- Superblock → SuperblockData
- Block → BlockData
- Challenge → ChallengeMetadata (NOT full ChallengeData)
- BlockLayout → BlockLayout enum
- BlockType → BlockType enum
